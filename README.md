# Fit Journal

An app that lets you easily track your workout program so you can gain better results. This app was created because I tried to track my workouts several different ways, and the most convenient was to type them onto my phone's note app. That was convenient but took too long and wasn't enjoyable.

Fit Journal is a free open source app that allows logged in users to keep track of their exercises, number of sets, reps, and weights used for each set.
